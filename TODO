- Add some property based tests (see hypothesis.readthedocs.io)
  - Moving from any state to the same state should take 4 moves: two for each player
  - Moving a block between two random positions should take at least the the infinity norm of the
    coordinates' distance, divided by two.
- Have better error messages for invalid moves
- Have some tests for inaccessible states (where a particular goal is impossible)
- Add some invalid actions for 'test_valid_action' to test
- Use hamming distance between EncState vectors as A* hueristic (as on the quiz)
