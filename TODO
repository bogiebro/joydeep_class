- Write tests
- Hueristics
- Normalize states for storage in MCTS cache: 0 should be about to play, and we should flip the board vertically to the orientation with the lowest hash.
- Keep track of parent state in MCTS so that we can backprop updates to the value functions.
- Keep track of parent state during MCTS tree traversal so we can call UCB with the number of parent counts.
